# flightplanner
A flight planner file creator program for Delphini-1

A script for generating flight planner files for the Delphini-1 satellite.

As for 25th of Oct. 2018, there is still some small problems that needs to be
sorted, such as if an error message occurs, it should return to ask for a new
input from user. However it will at this time create the .txt flight planner file.

The flight planner is not yet tested in flight.
